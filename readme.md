## Static Comp-3 ##

Overview

This is the third Static Comp Challenge for Module one.  This challenge encompasses
almost all HTML and CSS aspects covered in the module.

HTML

The HTML in this comp was built and structured first using the desktop version in mind.
Reasoning behind this approach came after several attempts to create from a mobile version up.
The composition is made up of many sections within sections containing many moveable parts and images.

CSS

After the HTML had been structured the styling began by first locating icons using Flaticon.com.  The selection of icons was compared to the composition and altered to match the color of grey used in the comp.
All colors were chosen using the built in digital color meter on the mac.  The composition was then broken down into sections.  ``<main>`` and ``<aside>`` being the major two blocks.  ``<main>`` was then broken down into sections to contain various elements.  Once completed the media queries were designed with max-width in mind.  As screen size is reduce the aside first disapears to become part of the lower nav menu found in the bottom of the heading.  Graphs then reduce in size and eventually the table and social media links are located under the table.  Upon the smallest of screens the lower nav menu will collapse on its self forming two rows of selections and the circle graphs become inline wth each other vertically.
